# ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Weather Prediction

## Overview
ClimateWins aims to use machine learning to predict weather conditions with data from the European Climate Assessment & Data Set (ECA&D) project.

## Objective
- Predict extreme weather events
- Evaluate supervised learning models
- Analyze the correlation between temperature and pleasant weather days

## Data Description
**Source:** ECA&D project  
**Biases:** Collection and sampling biases

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forests**
- **CNN & RNN**
- **GAN**

## Summary
- KNN showed consistency; optimization needed
- Future steps: optimize Decision Tree, explore ensemble methods
